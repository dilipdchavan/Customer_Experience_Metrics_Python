# Customer_Experience_Metrics_Python

This Customer experience metric depends on your company’s product, marketing, targets & more. Nowadays most the company’s trying to follow omnichannel approach, as Customer is in center. 
Customer experience metric include factors such as customer satisfaction and loyalty measurements that are known to correlated with revenue growth and margin improvement. 
In our example, we will be using a sample dataset of an online retail. For an online retail, we can select our North Star Metric as Monthly Revenue. Let’s see how our data look like on jupyter notebook.

## We have all the crucial information we need:
•	Customer ID
•	Unit Price
•	Quantity
•	Invoice Date

## We will derive following Additional Metrics in python.
•	Monthly Order Count
•	Average Revenue per Order
•	New Customer Ratio
•	Revenue per month for New and Existing Customers
•	Monthly Retention Rate
### Cohort Based Retention Rate
There is another way of measuring Retention Rate which allows you to see Retention Rate for each cohort. Cohorts are determined as first purchase year-month of the customers. We will be measuring what percentage of the customers retained after their first purchase in each month. This view will help us to see how recent and old cohorts differ regarding retention rate and if recent changes in customer experience affected new customer’s retention or not.

Finally…We know our customer experience metrics and how to track/analyze them with Python.
